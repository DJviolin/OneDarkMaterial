I've made this package to turn combine to awesome things in two awesome text editors. Combining Sublime Text 3 speed with Atom.io UI Theme and color scheme, with some modern modifications using material design concept.
This is my perfect workspace and I hope someone like it to. Use it without any problem, and tell me what do you like or would like to change in the theme.
